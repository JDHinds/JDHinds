# Murder at Mulligan's

## Ground Rules

### 1. Luck Checks

This adventure may call for "Luck Checks". This is a homebrew rule, that calls for the player to make a straight d20 roll. They are allowed to use any Lucky/Inspiration type abilities on this.

### 2. Rule of Cool

The style of DMing is to play barely by the rules. If something is cool enough, it will always be possible, and if it's really cool, you'll get inspiration for it.

### 3. Pace of Play

This adventure is designed to be a high speed, frantic social deduction adventure.

## Mystery Info:

- Showman, Edward, is murdered on stage. There's certain abjuration magic that guards it from the audience, so it had to be a member of staff.
- In the upstairs Offices, there are documents that lay plain the bankruptcy in the restaurant. The main drive is Edward and his performance skills.
- Separately, speaking to any lower-level staff, the party can discern that Edward wants to quit. And he would likely take the crowds with him.
- The owner of this establishment, a drow called Oisin, has been having an affair with Edward. His husband was about to find out.
- Sharon, the head cook, is inaccessible to speak to for most of the adventure, due to the modrone. She can be reported to be feeling that her talents are wasted in a gag restaurant like this. She has a finical stake, though, so she has to wait until it fails before she can move on.
- The front of house, an enby teifling, looks to be the next presenter, but while Eddie still works here, they will never get the chance.

- During the murder, servers say they saw a figure running behind the stage, into the kitchen.
