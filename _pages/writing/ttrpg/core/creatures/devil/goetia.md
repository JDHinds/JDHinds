# The Ars Goetia

### The Seven Deadly Sins
Above all other demons rule these seven, considered almost equal with Lucifer herself. Besides
- Lucifer, the imprisoned,
- Leviathan, the outsider, and
- Belphagor, the slothful
The sins are responsible for the Ministry of Circles 2-5.

| Position | Name      | Domain          | Ministry                     |
| -------- | --------- | --------------- | ---------------------------- |
| 0        | Lucifer   | Sin of Pride    | The Perfect Prison           |
| 1        | Beelzebub | Sin of Gluttony | The 3rd Circle               |
| 5        | Asmodeus  | Sin of Lust     | The 2nd Circle               |
| 7        | Mammon    | Sin of Greed    | The 4th Circle (Co-Minister) |
| 12       | Satan     | Sin of Wrath    | The 5th Circle               |
| 68       | Belphagor | Sin of Sloth    | None                         |
| X        | Leviathan | Sin of Envy     | The beyond realms            |

**Kings:**
The Kings are the next most powerful demons. They hold power over lesser sins, and control Circles 1, 4, 6-9.

| Position | Name   | Domain         | Ministry       |
| -------- | ------ | -------------- | -------------- |
| 9        | Paimon | King of Heresy | The 6th Circle |

13 - Beleth, King of Violence, & Minister to the Seventh Circle
20 - Purson, King of Avarice, & Co-Minister to the Fourth Circle
45 - Vine, King of Treachery, & Minister to the Ninth Circle
51 - Balam, King of Fraud, & Minister to the Eight Circle
61 - Zagan, King of Limbo, & Minister to the First Circle

> ### Co-Ministers of the Fourth Circle?
> 
> The domains of Greed and Avarice are very close to each other. Some might even consider them synonyms.
> 
> No one's really quite sure how it happened. Perhaps a cruel twist of The Creator forced the pair to share such sins, where they must actively compete with each other. Perhaps they were assigned these, at the start of the the hellish regime, and forced to share. Or, perhaps the funniest, they may just be both unwilling to give up their greed to each other.
